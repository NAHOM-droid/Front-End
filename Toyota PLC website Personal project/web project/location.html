		Toyota Canada Inc. has been in production in Canada 
		since 1983 with an aluminium wheel plant in Delta, 
		British Columbia, which currently employs a workforce 
		of roughly 260. Its first vehicle assembly plant, in 
		Cambridge, Ontario, since 1988, now produces Corolla 
		compact cars, Matrix crossover vehicles, and Lexus 
		RX 350 luxury SUVs, with a workforce of 4,300 workers.
		Its second assembly operation in Woodstock, Ontario, 
		began manufacturing the RAV4 late in 2008.In 2006, 
		Toyota's subsidiary Hino Motors opened a heavy duty 
		truck plant, also in Woodstock, employing 45 people 
		and producing 2000 trucks annually.

		Toyota has a large presence in the United States with 
		six major assembly plants in Huntsville, Alabama, 
		Georgetown, Kentucky, Princeton, Indiana, San Antonio, 
		Texas, Buffalo, West Virginia, and Blue Springs, 
		Mississippi. Toyota had a joint-venture operation 
		with General Motors at New United Motor Manufacturing 
		Inc. in Fremont, California, which began in 1984 and 
		ended in 2009.It still has a joint venture with Subaru 
		at Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc. in Lafayette, 
		Indiana, which started in 2006. In these assembly 
		plants, the Camry and the Tundra are manufactured, 
		among others.

		Australia was one of the first countries to assemble 
		Toyotas outside Japan. However, in February 2014, 
		Toyota was the last of Australia's major automakers 
		to announce the end of production in Australia. The 
		closure of Toyota's Australian plant will be completed 
		by 2017. Before Toyota, Ford and GM's Holden had 
		announced similar moves, all citing an unfavorable 
		currency and attendant high manufacturing costs.
