    <TD width=60%>Toyota is one of the largest companies to push hybrid electric vehicles in
        the market and the first to commercially mass-produce and sell such vehicles,
        with the introduction of the Toyota Prius in 1997. The company eventually 
        began providing this option on the main smaller cars such as Camry and later 
        with the Lexus divisions, producing some hybrid luxury vehicles. It labeled 
        such technology in Toyota cars as "Hybrid Synergy Drive" and in Lexus versions
        as "Lexus Hybrid Drive."</td>

   <TD>The Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid (or Prius PHV) is a mid-size plug-in hybrid. 
     The first generation Prius PHV was based on a third generation Toyota Prius 
     (model ZVW30) outfitted with 4.4 kWh lithium-ion batteries co-developed with
     Panasonic,[1][2] which enable all-electric operation at higher speeds and
     longer distances than the conventional Prius hybrid.[2] Production of the 
     first generation Prius Plug-in ended in June 2015.[3] The second generation
     plug-in, called the Toyota Prius Prime, is based on the fourth generation 
     Toyota Prius (model XW50). Deliveries of the Prime are scheduled to begin 
     in the United States by late 2016.</td>

  <TD>Our company began a development and demonstration program to test the Toyota FCHV,
      a hybrid hydrogen fuel cell vehicle based on the Toyota Highlander production 
      SUV. Toyota also built a FCHV bus based on the Hino Blue Ribbon City low-floor
      bus.[146][147] Toyota has built several prototypes/concepts of the FCHV since 
      1997, including the Toyota FCHV-1, FCHV-2, FCHV-3, FCHV-4, and Toyota FCHV-adv.
      The Toyota FCV-R fuel cell concept car was unveiled at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show. 
      The FCV-R sedan seats four and has a fuel cell stack including a 70 MPa high-pressure 
      hydrogen tank, which can deliver a range of 435 mi (700 km) under the Japanese JC08 
      test cycle. Toyota said the car was planned for launch in about 2015.</td>

  <TD>Our company showcased its trumpet-playing robot.Toyota has been developing multitask 
     robots destined for elderly care, manufacturing, and entertainment. A specific example 
     of Toyota's involvement in robotics for the elderly is the Brain Machine Interface. 
     Designed for use with wheelchairs, it "allows a person to control an electric wheelchair 
     accurately, almost in real-time", with his or her mind.The thought controls allow 
     the wheelchair to go left, right, and forward with a delay between thought and movement 
     of just 125 milliseconds.Toyota also played a part in the development of Kirobo, 
     a 'robotic astronaut'.</td>

  <TD>Our company developed an oekaki-style sewing machine called the Oekaki Renaissance, 
      which, like others of its type, is designed to allow the user to be able to 
      draw ideas directly onto fabric using the art of free-motion embroidery.</td>
